Before running anything you need to install the requirements on the folder requirements
  using pip

1. python3 -m venv venv
2. source venv/bin/activate
3. pip install -r requirements/[desired requirements]

There are three requirements files
one to execute the preprocessing program
and another two to execute programs related to SVM (training and predict)
  and to DNN (also training and predict)
